# Mission-to-Mars

## Web-scraping for Mars information

### Our analysis consists of these three deliverables:

  - Deliverable 1: Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
  - Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
  - Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
  
### Summary
**1** Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, you’ll scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

**2** Using your Python and HTML skills, you’ll add the code you created in Deliverable 1 to your scraping.py file, update your Mongo database, and modify your index.html file so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.. 

**3** For this part of the Challenge, update your web app to make it mobile-responsive, and add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.
- Added Rounded edge to images. 
- Made the Buttom a "success" button
